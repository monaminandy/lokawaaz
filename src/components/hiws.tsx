          Step 1: Sign Up Securely <br />
Users begin by signing up with their email and verifying their identity using Civic Auth, which includes a facial scan and OTP/email verification.
<br /><br />
Step 2: Upload Voter ID & Aadhaar <br />
Users upload scanned copies or images of their Voter ID and Aadhaar card through our secure form.
<br /><br />
Step 3: AI Face Match Verification <br />
Our system uses AI-powered facial recognition to match the user's live face scan with the photo on the Aadhaar card for authenticity.
<br /><br />
Step 4: Smart Validation Check <br />
The platform checks that the email used in sign-up matches the email authenticated via Civic, and ensures documents are valid and eligible.
<br /><br />
Step 5: Store & Protect Data <br />
The verified name and Voter ID are securely stored in our MongoDB Atlas database, ensuring both privacy and accessibility.
<br /><br />
Step 6: Ready to Participate <br />
Once verified, users are ready to proceed – whether it’s digital voter services, e-voting, or exploring local election info.
